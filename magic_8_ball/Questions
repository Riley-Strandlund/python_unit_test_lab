# Why would it be hard to write tests for original_magic.py?  
There are no functions to specifically target to test

# Why was it re-written as functions, and why were the functions used chosen? 
You can select a function to test a part of the project instead of a whole

# What else could you test about this program?
Test if the url was grabbed properly 
Test if it properly received a response


# What types of expected, and unexpected behavior might happen?


# What is within the program's control? What is outside the program's control? 


# Think about what valid, and invalid input could be passed to the functions. Remember that functions should not make any assumptions about how they will be called.
